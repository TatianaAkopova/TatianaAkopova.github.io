&mdash;Here's Antonina Petrovna's granddaughter, she's quite something. She moved to the capital, Moscow and now she's tutoring there - my grandmother shares news. - She hung up advertisements in the entryways, and that's it - now she's teaching English to students at her home. What a businesswoman!- my grandmother can't hide her admiration.

&mdash;Oh, she's quite the entrepreneur! -  I reply with a touch of sarcasm.

&mdash;Yes, you're not like that, you can't do that. You're too modest for that - my grandma concludes. 

&mdash;Well, grandma, isn't it something that I flew to Vietnam one way and found a job there? 

My grandmother laughs at the whole thing, not knowing what to answer. 

Have you ever noticed how our closest friends and family see us through a unique set of lenses? They've known us from the days when we were just curious kids, and sometimes, those early impressions stick with us throughout our lives. ðŸŒŸ

To our childhood friends, we might forever be the adventurous explorer who climbed trees and laughed without a care. To our parents, we're still the little ones they watched take their first steps. To our grandparents we are that little modest clumsy little kid. 

It's in the eyes of those who've known us since we were young that we're sometimes labeled as 'the responsible one,' 'the creative spirit,' or 'the modest oneâ€™.  These labels can be both comforting and puzzling, shaping our self-perception in unique ways. ðŸŽ¨

So, while the labels from our loved ones hold a special place in our hearts, we are not confined by any single definition. We are complex, ever-evolving beings, shaped by our experiences, dreams, and the choices we make each day.

Letâ€™s recognize that we can be 'the adventurous explorer,' 'the responsible one,' and so much more, all within a single lifetime. We don't need to be pigeonholed into one role or label. Our true beauty lies in our multifaceted nature. ðŸŒŸðŸ’«
