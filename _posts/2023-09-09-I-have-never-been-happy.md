&mdash;I have never been happy. I have never gone to work happy. And I am already 76. Turns out all my life was useless, all’s in vain, - I heard an elderly man near the central market telling his partner.

As I overheard this piece of conversation I pondered how often we underestimate the importance of happiness in our daily lives and how we only grasp the significance of happiness when it becomes a distant memory. In the man’s voice I heard a regret, which echoed as a realisation that a lifetime spent without joy can leave a haunting sense of purposelessness. The regret in his words served as a cautionary tale, urging us to reassess our priorities and cherish the moments of joy that life generously offers before they slip into the past. It is a reminder to live a life that, when looked back, is not marred by the haunting question of what could have been.
