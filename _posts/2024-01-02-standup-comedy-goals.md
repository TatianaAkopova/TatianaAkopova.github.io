&mdash;Oh, standup, I see. I remember one comedian, Maria, do you know her? - a talkative taxi driver asked me, assuming I know all Marias of stand-up.

&mdash;Maria? I'm not sure I know all Marias doing standup, - I replied, genuinely curious about where this conversation was headed.

&mdash;Well, she used to be quite popular on the stand-up scene, making people laugh left and right. But then she disappeared, maybe she got married, - the taxi driver concluded, his voice tinged with a hint of nostalgia.

&mdash;Sorry, how are these two connected? - I nearly burst into laughter, unable to fathom the link between stand-up comedy and marriage.

&mdash;Well, wasn't it her whole goal to do stand-up? To promote herself in order to get married? - the taxi driver looked puzzled as if he was telling the universal truth which I couldn't quite grasp.

As the taxi driver's words lingered in the air, it struck me how vastly different our perceptions of life's purpose could be. The thought of Maria's stand-up comedy as a strategy to find a partner was a testament to the diverse ways we all seek fulfillment and happiness.

I realized that sometimes these differences are so profound that it's futile to start an argument or try to convince someone of our perspective. 

Life's richness lies in its diversity, and in that moment, I chose to simply nod and smile, appreciating the taxi driver's unique outlook. In the big picture of life itâ€™s the different experiences and people that create the most interesting stories.
