I have always thought red was for losers. That’s what I’ve been told. My clothes have never had a hint of red colour and I have never worn anything red until the recent years.

&mdash;Do you like this shirt? - I asked my mom, pointing to a red shirt on a market.
&mdash;Ugh, - my mom’s interjection was full of disgust.- I hate red! - she declared as we passed to another stand with clothes, as it was obvious red should not be the choice.

For years, I lived by that simple rule: red was off-limits. It was more than just a color; it was a symbol of something undesirable, something to be avoided. 

Several years ago I bought a red dress. It felt weird. It wasn't just about the color; it was about choice and realization that my preferences need not be reflections of my upbringing. The dress was a symbol of a contrast to the values and beliefs that had been handed down to me without question.

I began to realize that while our parents profoundly influence us, there comes a time when we must sift through these inherited beliefs and habits to discover our true selves. 

In my journey, the red dress became a metaphor for this transformation. It taught me that our likes and dislikes, our opinions and beliefs, are often more impressionable than we think, shaped by the hands of those who raise us. But they can be reshaped, reformed as we step into our own light, guided by our own values and understanding.

The process of aligning these newly formed parts of myself with the remnants of my upbringing is ongoing. Although red still has not become my favourite colour, one thing is certain: red is no longer a color for losers. For me it stands for the freedom of choice, and for the power of evolving beyond what we’ve always been told.
