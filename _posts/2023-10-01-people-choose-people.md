People choose people. They choose people, and only after that - everything else.

I don’t know whether I would have continued practicing yoga if it hadn’t been for my yoga teachers who inspired me. I realised that when my yoga teacher was absent one day and had been replaced by another yoga instructor. Everything seemed so familiar - poses and asanas, the practice itself - yet something was different.

The energy was different, as well as the tone of voice and body language. I looked around: among my regular yoga buddies I saw a lot of unfamiliar faces. They must have come from other clubs, but to that particular yoga teacher. Unfamiliar yoga lovers also chose their one and only yoga instructor. They were ready to migrate from club to club together with their yoga teacher, a yoga mat and hope to do a headstand with support of familiar hands.
I don’t know whether I would have continued to work so hard on my English if it hadn’t been for my school teacher of English. It’s utterly important to detect a spark of interest in another person and add fuel to this fire of interest until the flame becomes strong and independent, ready to ignite new sparks in others.

"You just need to stop at a certain point", - my dentist, an elderly man with “a strong attitude” presumably formed in rough Soviet times, was removing air bubbles from a lidocaine syringe, - "You can’t just keep choosing and picking all your life, running around, searching who is better, comparing all the time".

I kept silent and nodded as a sign of consent. What else is there to do when your mouth is full with gauze rolls, saliva ejector and a lidocaine syringe is moving towards you?

"You just need to stop some day", - my dentist reclined in his chair after he’d made an injection, - "and choose your one. And only. Your dentist. It will be easier for you. For you and for us. Mark my words."

They say people come into your life for a reason, a season and a lifetime.
Some people come and go, others stay with you longer.
We choose these people ourselves.
And these people choose us.
We choose some people every day.
We choose others for one hour per week.
Choose wisely. Life is short.
